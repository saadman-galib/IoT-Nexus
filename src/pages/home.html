                IoT stands for the "Internet of Things." It refers to the
                network of physical objects, devices, vehicles, buildings, and
                other items that are embedded with sensors, software, and
                connectivity, allowing them to collect and exchange data over
                the internet.

                These "smart" objects can communicate with each other and with
                humans, creating a seamless and interconnected system of
                devices. IoT technology enables a wide range of applications,
                from smart homes and cities to industrial automation and
                healthcare.

    <h1>How IoT Works?</h1>
    <div class="about-section-text">
        <p>
            IoT technology works by enabling physical objects or "things" to
            communicate with each other and with humans through sensors,
            connectivity, and software. Here's a basic overview of how IoT
            works:

                    Physical objects or "things" are equipped with sensors that
                    collect data on various parameters, such as temperature,
                    humidity, motion, or location.

                <h2>Connectivity</h2>
                <p>
                    The devices are connected to the internet or a local network
                    through various means, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular
                    networks, or satellite.

                <h2>Data processing</h2>
                <p>
                    The data collected by the sensors is processed and analyzed
                    using software, often through cloud computing platforms, to
                    extract meaningful insights or take actions based on the
                    data.

                    The insights or actions derived from the data can be used in
                    various applications, such as smart homes, healthcare
                    monitoring, industrial automation, or traffic management.

            IoT technology relies on a combination of hardware, software, and
            networking technologies to create an interconnected system of
            devices that can communicate with each other and with humans. It has
            the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives and enable
            new applications that were not possible before.
