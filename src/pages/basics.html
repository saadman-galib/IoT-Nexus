            <p>
                The concept of IoT dates back to the 1980s, when researchers at
                Carnegie Mellon University connected a vending machine to the
                internet to monitor its inventory and temperature. However, it
                wasn't until the 1990s that the term "Internet of Things" was
                first coined, by a British technologist named Kevin Ashton.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the 2000s, IoT technologies continued to develop and
                expand, particularly in the fields of industrial automation and
                smart homes. The introduction of IPv6 in 1998 also paved the way
                for a greater number of devices to be connected to the internet,
                as it allowed for trillions of unique IP addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past decade, the proliferation of smartphones and other
                mobile devices has led to an explosion in the number of
                connected devices, with estimates that there will be over 30
                billion IoT devices in use by 2025. This has led to a greater
                focus on data analytics and machine learning, as organizations
                look to extract valuable insights from the vast amounts of data
                generated by IoT devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the history of IoT has been characterized by a steady
                progression from early research and experimentation to
                widespread adoption and commercialization, with an increasing
                emphasis on connectivity, data analytics, and automation.
